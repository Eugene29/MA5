#### 1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?
The most interesting topic that our domain capstone has covered so far is Graph Transformer.
#### 2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.
We have a pretty stringent final project where we have to alleviate long range interaction in Graph Neural Networks
#### 3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?
Our current quarter 1 project will only investigate existing GNNs that alleviate long range interaction while next quarter, we will propose novel ideas that might alleviate the problem.
#### 4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?
Techniques that I would be interested in using our project is variations of Virtual Node and Graph Transformer where we temper with how virtual node interacts and attention weights in GT.
